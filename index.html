          A hardworking and motivated ex recruiter who is looking to
          continuously grow and enhance his software development experience.
          Having always had an interest in technology and a knack for problem
          solving and after speaking with numerous developers about their roles
          and time in the industry I have concluded that the best thing for my
          development is to follow my passion and make the leap into the
          development space. Previous experience has taught me many transferable
          skills, such as careful analysis, organisational and administrative
          skills.
